# FakeMalware 
#### version 1.2.1
- this is old project, so the code is bad, i know xd

### Special startup
- You can start the app with custom arguments which contains your custom settings for start in troll mode
- When you save settings in autostart panel, autostart.json will be created, then you need to rename the file (autostart.json) to something else and then you can use it to startup app with custom setting by cmd
```batch
start FakeMalware.exe <custom_file.json>

rem default settings
start FakeMalware.exe autostart.json
```
the only way to close this program is to run this command in cmd:
```batch
taskkill -F -IM FakeMalware.exe
```
